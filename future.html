<p class = "col-6">On the second page, describe where you're going in life and who you'll become. Tell us about your career goals, education goals, hopes, dreams, etc. For example: I'm excited to start Galvanize and learn about web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enrolled in the web development immersive because I've always been fascinated by the web's ability to bring people together. After Galvanize, I would love to work for a social network company like Snapchat or OKCupid.</p>
