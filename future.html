I will graduate from Galvanize in June 2017 and will be applying for jobs as a Web Developer. I would like to get a job working as a developer for a college or other educational instituition. This would enable me to keep learning and eventually teach programming courses. I would also like to be a developer for a large tech company or anywhere else that will be conducive to me honing my programming skills. I favor front-end development, so ideally my career will focus in this area.
